        He wants to destroy everything outside the walls, and he wants to do it
        because he thinks that there is no way for paradise island to survive if
        the outside word does so too Eren has been shown time and time again
        that many nations (and significant chunks of their population) are
        insanely anti-erdian, there is constant talk of eliminating “the Erdian
        demons” and those of his people that do love outside paradise are
        treated as Sub-humans. That doesn’t end there. Marley, the strongest
        military power in the word (with over a million strong army) is
        attacking paradise and actively seeking its destruction. Eren has few
        years left to live, he doesn’t know who will inherit his powers, if
        someone he holds dears does so, that person will be condemned to a short
        life. On the other hand, if that person is a stranger, he has no way to
        trust him His half brother Zeke forces his hand by pushing his own plan
        “euthanasia”.If Eren doesn’t succeed, Zeke will At the end, Eren kills
        them because he wishes “freedom” for those that he loves, he wants them
        to live without fear, he wants them to live
