      <p>
        In year 845, after Eren and Carla have a discussion about Eren's wish to
        join the Survey Corps, Grisha promises him to show him an important secret
        he is hiding in the basement, and then leaves to work. A still upset Eren
        flees from the house and Carla sends Mikasa after him. But while the three
        are away from home, the Colossus and Armored Titans breach the Wall on
        Shiganshina and a flood of Titans invades the district. One of the debris
        that flies out of the Wall due to the Colossus Titan's kick falls on the
        Yeagers' house, destroying it and crushing Carla's legs. Despite Eren and
        Mikasa's attempts to rescue her, Hannes drags them from there when the
        Smiling Titan approaches. The kids then impotently witness as a helpless
        Carla is murdered and eaten by the Titan.[17]

      Later on that night, Grisha hears the news of the fall of Shiganshina and,
      enraged at the Reiss family due to their refusal to free humanity from the
      Titans despite possessing the power to do it, goes to the Reiss Chapel and
      faces the then holder of the Coordinate, Frieda Reiss. The two of them
      transform into Titans and fight, but Grisha defeats Frieda and eats her,
      murdering her and stealing the Coordinate. He then proceeds to slaughter
      the whole family, with the exception of Rod, who barely manages to escape,
      and Historia, who was living on a farm by then.[18][19] <img
      style="width:500px" src="eren5.jpg"> Grisha then goes to the shelter where
      Eren and Mikasa are staying as refugees and learns from Eren that Carla
      has died.[20] Grisha takes Eren into the forest and, as he gives him the
      key to the basement and instructs him to find it, by all means[21], he
      injects Eren with a Titan serum, triggering a transformation into a Pure
      Titan by Eren. The now mindless Eren grabs Grisha and bites him in half,
      inheriting his Titan transformation and Coordinate powers. After regaining
      his human form, Eren finds the remains of his father next to him and
      passes out in shock.[22] He is later found by Keith Shadis, who takes him
      back to the shelter.[23]

      Eren later wakes up with no memory of that event as a side effect of the
      Titan serum,[24][21] but he still retained the key and after that day he
      always wore it around his neck.[25] The two kids and their best friend
      Armin Arlert apparently live alone for the next two years and helped in
      the fields.[26] In year 847 they enlist in the 104th Training
      Corps[27][28] and three years later, the three graduate and join the
      Survey Corps.

      Return to Shiganshina arc During the Battle of Shiganshina District, Eren
      crosses paths with Zeke, who recognizes and promises to save Eren after
      claiming they are both victims of Grisha.[29] Eren, Mikasa, Levi, and
      Hange later go to the Yeager basement and find three books hidden in the
      false bottom of a drawer. The first contains a photograph of Grisha Yeager
      with a woman and a little kid, revealing he came from beyond the
      Walls.[30] The books tell Grisha's story, beginning with the day his
      sister Faye was killed off.[31]

      After the Marley Mid-East War, Zeke reunites with his grandparents who
      praise him for carrying out his mission successfully.[32] During Eren's
      infiltration into Marley in the year 854, he meets with his half-brother
      Zeke in a hospital. Together, they discuss Eren's inheritance of their
      father's memories, and Grisha's slaughter of the Reiss family. Eren claims
      to disagree with his father's approach, stating that Eldians would not
      have to suffer if they had not been born. With this, Eren agrees to Zeke's
      euthanasia plan and takes a baseball as a token of their agreement.[33]
      <img style="width: 700px" src="dhia6.jpg" />
      Eren also meets his grandfather in the hospital whilst under the guise of
      being an amnesiac war-veteran named "Kruger." They have a conversation
      about the Grice family, and Yeager asks Kruger to stop using Falco Grice
      for favors that could damage his family's reputation. He also tells Kruger
      to return to his family as soon as he is healthy. Eren notes Yeager seems
      to have regrets surrounding his own family; he is solemnly told that the
      man regrets the fates his children met every day. Blaming himself because
      of the methods he used to raise his son, the elder Yeager suffers a mental
      breakdown and is soon taken away.[34] A few days later at Willy Tybur's
      speech, Eren Yeager has his name disgraced when he is declared to the
      world as the enemy of peace.[35] In the resulting conflict, Eren inherits
      the War Hammer Titan, bringing a fourth Titan power into the possession of
      the Yeager family.[36]

      Following Marley's revenge for Liberio by invading Shiganshina, Zeke
      reunites with Eren to help him fend off his attackers[37] and when Eren
      ends up getting decapitated by Gabi Braun,[38] Zeke makes contact with him
      and the two brothers are transported to the Coordinate.[39] Eren shocks
      Zeke by revealing that he had only pretended to go along with Zeke's plan
      so that he could enter the Coordinate.[40] Though disheartened, Zeke
      blames it on Grisha brainwashing Eren and resolves to save Eren by forcing
      him to witness their father's memories. Contrary to Zeke's expectations,
      he discovers that Grisha was willing to set aside his mission to retake
      the Founder in favor of staying with his family, and learns that Grisha
      never stopped thinking about him.[41] Zeke comes to accept that Eren has
      never been manipulated by their father. However, Eren sends his father
      memories of the fall of Wall Maria through the Attack Titan, prompting his
      visit to the Reiss family the night the Wall falls. Though his father
      hesitates at the idea of killing the entire family, Eren goads him into
      doing it, reminding Grisha of everyone who has died to get him this far.
      Zeke becomes disillusioned with Eren and commands Ymir Fritz to remove the
      ability for all Subjects of Ymir to reproduce.[42] Eren forcefully breaks
      free of the shackles Zeke restrained him with and grabs Ymir, telling her
      that she does not have to be a slave and obey Zeke's orders. She has the
      ability to choose. He believes she is the one who led him here, and that
      she has been waiting for 2,000 years. Ymir hears Eren and lifts her head
      in tears. Back in the real world, a centipede-like substance connects
      Eren's decapitated head with his body, initiating the Rumbling.[43] Using
      the power of the Founding Titan, Eren announces his intention to kill
      everyone in the outside world in order to protect the people of
      Paradis.[44] A truce is made between the surviving Warriors and remnants
      of the Survey Corps to stop the Rumbling.[45] The assembled group pursues
      Eren to Fort Salta where they try to locate Zeke atop Eren's enormous
      skeletal Founding Titan form, knowing Zeke's royal blood is enabling the
      marching Wall Titans.[46] Ymir creates numerous puppet Titans to defend
      Eren and when one of them captures Armin in its mouth,[47] he meets Zeke
      in Paths.[48] Zeke tells Armin that Eren understood Ymir when he could
      not, and Armin manages to convince him to help them stop Eren. Zeke
      partially emerges from one of the Founding Titan's spines and calls out to
      Levi, who immediately decapitates him, stopping the Rumbling.[49] After
      Eren's skeletal Founding Titan is exploded by Armin transforming on top of
      it, Eren survives and transforms into a different Titan form, skinless and
      as tall as Armin's Titan. With Armin and Levi's help, Mikasa discovers
      Eren's location and enters his Titan's mouth, severing Eren's head from
      the spine.[50]
